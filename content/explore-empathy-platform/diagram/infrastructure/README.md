::: slot remark
Empathy Platform infrastructure has evolved with the product by facing and overcoming the most complex engineering scenarios to offer customers a robust solution that provides consistency, scalability, reliability, and security. 
Empathy Platform uses state-of-the-art engineering to automate development, builds, and deployment for fewer interventions, risks, and dependencies.

Empathy Platform infrastructure is fully cloud agnostic, actively minimizing dependencies on third-party providers, and offers poly-cloud and single or multi-tenancy options. Empathy Platform’s portability strategy is based on Kubernetes, allowing microservices to be deployed, scaled, and managed at scale. Not only that, Empathy’s Cloud FinOps focus brings financial accountability, optimizing resource usage and costs by design.
