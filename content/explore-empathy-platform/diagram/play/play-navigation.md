Product discovery doesnâ€™t stop with the search experience, so neither does Empathy Platform. You can configure the whole navigation experience by choosing the **faceting options** to be displayed in the navigation menu, and change the labels used for each facet and the order in which they appear. You can apply **product & attribute ranking rules** to products listed in the product category pages (PCP). You can preview and check how the configuration affects the browsing experience.
