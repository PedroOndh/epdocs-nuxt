Understand the evolution of search with **success metrics** based on the number of sessions, queries, and queries per session, as well as CTR, findability, add to cart, and checkout. Identify **search dead-ends with no results**. Learn and discover the distribution of all queries made in your commerce or explore the breakdown for a specific query, filtering by date and other custom fields such as language and device.

The Playboard connects to the [Statistics microservice](../microservices/stats-service.md) to retrieve and display statistical reports about the **total number of queries** made, the number of **queries per session**, the **percentage of no results**, as well as **click-through rates**, **findability**, and **add-to-cart data** per query and overall. Analytics is complemented by real-time information offered by **[Insights](play-insights.md)**.
