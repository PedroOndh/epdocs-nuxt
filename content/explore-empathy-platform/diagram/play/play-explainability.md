Understanding the what, why, and how of each search

::: slot remark
With multiple advanced search capabilities, working out why products appear where they do within the search engine results page (SERP) is often a complicated process due to the multiple factors involved.   
 
The Explain tool in the Empathy Platform Playboard brings transparency one step closer, helping merchandisers understand what factors have influenced a productâ€™s position within the results. View how the current **weighting of the product catalogue attributes** affects the positioning of the product, determine whether specific **business logic** and **custom rules** have been applied to, for example, boost or bury the product manually, and see how other factors such as **shoppers' collective behavior** can all add up to override the organic position. Check out the products returned for a specific query, ranked in order, and compare different products to understand the origin of the differences in positioning.
