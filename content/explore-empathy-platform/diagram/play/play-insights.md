Be inspired by your shoppers’ experience through enlightening data visualizations.

Empathy Platform's Insights transforms raw data by the [Statistics microservice](../microservices/stats-service.md) and transforms it into actionable information. Discover the **most used queries and search terms** in your commerce store over the last 15 minutes, one hour, or 12 hours in a meaningful and delightful way. Watch how shoppers interact with your commerce store in real-time, and explore **search term performance** in terms of queries, clicks, and no results. Pinpoint **trending terms** that lead to dead-end searches, so you can adapt to the situation instantly with the Playboard's [Tooling](play-tooling.md), and see the **source of your queries**, whether they result from organic searches, search refinement, and predictive suggestions.
