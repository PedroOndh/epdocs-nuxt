**ALSO** *Tags*, *Related keywords*

The Related Tags feature suggests terms that usually go with the current query to complement it, providing extra and relevant information for a more precise search. They appear after launching a broad, generic search and are shown as labels usually at the top of the results page, but can be displayed anywhere instead.  

They are intended especially for those shoppers who aren’t good at query formulation, helping them narrow down the search and get highly relevant results.

Related tags are determined by query context data based on previous sessions and different shoppers. The underlying [Tagging microservices](../microservices/tagging-service/) track and analyse the query information to predict shoppers’ intention, returning a set of pairing terms that best complement the initial query.

You can orchestrate the experience and content of Related Tags for a specific query according to your business strategy using no-code controls with the [Empathy Playboard](../play/). For example, you can create, modify, delete, or even re-sort related tags and blacklist search terms.
