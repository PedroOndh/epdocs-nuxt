Expressive search and discovery
:::

::: slot remark

The presentation layer that guides users to what they are looking for, wrapped up in a smooth design. Here search interface and user experience are the central focus, empowered by numerous [frontend components](../../experience-search-and-discovery/) that allow you to design impressive and frictionless search experiences.

What's more, the interface acts also as a touchpoint to feed the [underlying microservices](../microservices/) with contextual information, returning inspirational experiences.
