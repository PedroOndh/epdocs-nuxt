**ALSO** *Top clicked*, *Top searched items*, *Trending products*

Recommendations are the most clicked and visited search results. So, this feature has become a quick and intuitive way to explore your product catalogue, guiding shoppers to specific products without the need to launch any queries. 

Displaying the top searched products is especially useful when there are no relevant results for the current search. But they can also be displayed together with other search suggestions before searching.

Recommendations are determined from the analysis of shoppers behaviour within a defined period. The underlying [Tagging microservices](../microservices/tagging-service/) collect and analyse contextual data to calculate the top clicked products for a selected date range and retrieve thus a set of the most clicked results.

With the [Empathy Playboard](../play/), you can configure the content of Recommendations with no-code controls, especially when you donâ€™t want to recommend specific products.
