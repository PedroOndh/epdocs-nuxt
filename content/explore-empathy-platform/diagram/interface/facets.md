Facets and Filters group products by categories and allow shoppers to limit the results according to their preferences to find the right product straight away.

Facets are intimately connected to filters, as they are like category containers. Whereas each facet corresponds to a result specific attribute or field (brand, size, colour, price, etc.), filters are about the corresponding value for each product to filter by ($ 10 - 30, XL - L - M - S - XS, white - black - blue…).

Behind the scenes, the search process starts with [indexing](../microservices/index-service) your product catalogue. Each product attribute and value is thoroughly analysed and categorised to bring out results in a faceted way. What’s more, when selecting a specific filter, the underlying [search process](../microservices/search-service) makes it possible to alter the result display, even activating new facets and filters.

<!-- to be checked: Based on the data tracked in the backend, statistical reports can be retrieved on the performance of filters, letting you discover which filters are most in your commerce store and the top values for a specific filter. -->

<!-- **Powered by** Index microservice, Search microservice, [Tagging microservices](../microservices/tagging-service/) -->

You can control and configure the navigation experience through Facets according to your business strategy with no-code controls using the [Empathy Playboard](../play/).
