Popular searches is a list of the top search terms in your shop for a given period. The popular search terms displayed aren’t necessarily related to your shoppers' intent or search history; they are hints for new searches and product discoveries.

Shoppers get a set of the most popular queries thanks to the contextual data tracked and processed at the backend level. The Empathy [Tagging microservices](../microservices/tagging-service/) analyse and understand every interaction to determine which searches are trending.

What's more, with the [Statistics microservice](stats-service) you can retrieve statistical reports about top queries and opportunities that help you to interpret your shoppers' preferences.

Take control over how popular searches are experienced according to your business strategy with the [Empathy Playboard](../play/). You can blacklist search terms without IT intervention so that they won’t appear in the popular searches list despite context data.
As an extra to the backend statistical reports, you can explore search terms in real time to identify search trends and opportunities and make accurate business decisions.
