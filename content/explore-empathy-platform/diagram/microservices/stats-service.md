The Statistics microservice is responsible for delivering reports generated from the data collected by the [Tagging microservices](tagging-service.md), offering **[insights](../play/play-insights) and [analytics](../play/play-analytics)** so you have a deeper understanding of your shoppers’ intentions and whether they’re finding what they’re looking for. 

Information is displayed in the [Empathy Platform Playboard](../play) or can be accessed using the [Statistics API](/develop-empathy-platform/api-reference/statistics-api) as standard reports, allowing you to easily track which queries are performing better or worse in real-time.
