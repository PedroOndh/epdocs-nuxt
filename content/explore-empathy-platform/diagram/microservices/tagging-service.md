Capturing the interaction data needed to enhance your search and discovery experience

::: slot remark

This is the first step in building your Empathy commerce search and discovery experience; without it, you wonâ€™t be able to build a meaningful conversation with shoppers.  

The Tagging microservices are responsible for [capturing shopper behavior](../../capture-shopper-interaction). Every shopper search query, click, and purchase generates a signal. These signals are collected, processed, and filtered by the Tagging microservices. They represent the starting point for providing **advanced search capabilities** using the Empathy batch processes, such as helping shoppers to formulate more useful queries and offering suggestions, as well as providing you with **context-rich insights** into shopper intent using the [Statistics microservice](stats-service) and [Play](../play/).

The Tagging microservices, via its [API](/develop-empathy-platform/api-reference/tagging-api.md), collect **search queries** launched by shoppers from the [search box](../interface/search-box.md), track the **clicks** on [recommendations](../interface/recommendations.md) and [popular searches](../interface/popular-searches.md), and provide the information needed to generate different **shopper suggestions** ([query suggestions](../interface/query-suggestions.md), [next queries](../interface/next-queries.md), etc.), and refine **new searches** using [related tags](../interface/related-tags.md), for example.
