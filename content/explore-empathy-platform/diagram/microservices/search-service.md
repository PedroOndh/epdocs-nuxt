The Search microservice gives the right answers to your shoppers’ requests. It's responsible for receiving the shopper’s query, finding the products that best match in your product feed, and returning the results on the search engine results page (SERP). 

This microservice provides extensive capabilities for showing the most relevant products in many ways to provide an enhanced search experience, right from the start. For example, tune the search logic and obtain results sets according to your business needs, playing with **product relevance**. Organize what shoppers see and how they see it with **[faceting](../interface/facets.md)**, **sorting**, and **pagination** options for narrowing down product results. Or avoid zero results by using **spell check** to always show relevant results despite spelling errors.  

Being the core of search, the Search microservice communicates with the other Empathy microservices, i.e. [Index](index-service), [Contextualize](contextualize-service), and [Play](play-service), to support **advanced search capabilities**, search **refinement options**, product and attribute **ranking** configurations, and search **intent models**.
