For the last few years, shoppers have switched over to online shopping. During this time, shoppers have started to question the (mis)use of their personal data without real consent or any transparency by online commerce stores. Undoubtedly, creating and sustaining reliable, inspiring, and joyful shopping experiences requires access to shoppers’ data, but it shouldn't exceed the limits of **ethical search**. 

First-party data practices have led to a growing **distrust** in commerce technology overall. Shoppers are no longer satisfied with commerce stores that do not give them control over their own data. It’s not that shoppers are reluctant to share personal information, rather they just want to know and understand what will be done with it and the benefits of sharing it. Shoppers now are willing to share their data **only** with those commerce stores that they **do really trust** and that let them regain control over their information. Then, how can brand trust be (re)built when it comes to shopper privacy?

> Empathy Platform approaches privacy as a human right, designing commerce search experiences that respect a shopper’s online privacy with offline standards. 

### Empathy Platform built with privacy by design

Empathy Platform provides the solution for ethical commerce search, based on a **trust-first** vision, so that shoppers can trust your commerce store without feeling being tracked or even spied on. Empathy Platform leverages respectful **collective events** to build contextualized search experiences **without storing any personally identifiable information (PII)**.  

To enrich the shopping experience while placing your shoppers’ privacy first, Empathy Platform fosters an ethical and responsible use of shoppers’ data in all stages of search data flow: capture, process, and persistence.

#### Data capture

**Privacy-first event data tracking** </br> To build contextual commerce search experiences, you need to establish first shopping preferences and infer shopper intent. Empathy Platform **Tagging microservices** allow you to capture different interactions in your commerce store using aggregate events. The Tagging microservices examine aggregate shopping practices & patterns and identify **collective shopping behavior**, rather than individual shopper actions, just by reading and not storing any PII at all. **No user IDs, no location data, no images, no voice, no device or browser information are stored, yet shoppers still get contextualization**.

Empathy Platform **doesn’t support image or voice search**. Both image and voice search compromise compliance requirements as images and voices may contain sensitive or identifiable information.

#### Data processing
**Conversational and intent services based on shoppers’ privacy** </br> Empathy Platform search is about understanding shoppers' intent. Create the perfect conversation between your commerce store and your shoppers, just like a personal shopper assistant would do in the offline world, by using the Empathy Platform's **intent and contextual microservices**. They use **PII-free aggregate data** from your commerce store to create meaningful search and discovery experiences.

Aggregate data is also processed and used for **data visualization and analytics**. The search [insights](/explore-empathy-platform/features/insights-overview.md) and statistics you access through the [Empathy Platform Playboard](/explore-empathy-platform/analyze-search-and-discovery/) are also based on **read-only data from collective shopping patterns**.

#### Data persistence
**Contextualized results based on privacy-first and wisdom of the crowd** </br> To deliver relevant, privacy-by-design product results and search suggestions, Empathy Platform uses truly **anonymized behavior patterns** (wisdom of the crowd) and **local-first storage**, where data stays with the shopper’s device. </br> Customize the discovery experience by improving the positioning of product results with Empathy Platform **Contextualize microservice**, which elevates product relevancy but doesn't store any individual profiling data.

For 1:1 personalization, Empathy Platform is in constant innovation, exploring **decentralized uses of personal data** where shoppers can decide what, how, and when to share or interact with the commerce store. A combination of practices based on **local-first**, **user** [**PODs**](https://solidproject.org/), and **read-only information** allows commerce search to shift from invasive tracking-based personalization to personalization based on purposeful sharing.
