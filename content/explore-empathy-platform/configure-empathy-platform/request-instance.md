As an Empathy partner, you can request a new instance directly from the Empathy Platform Playboard.

You request an instance from the **[Instances](/explore-empathy-platform/overview/playboard-overview.md#instances)** page when you log into the Playboard. You enter a display name for the instance and any comments to be considered when creating the new instance.

::: warning

Only Playboard users with **permissions for Instance Management** can request a new instance. 

:::

![Request an instance](~@assets/media/instance-mgt/config-request-instance.svg)

To request an instance:

1. Click **Request instance**.
2. Enter a descriptive name in **Instance display name**.
3. If you have any comments or need to request access for other users, you can enter this information in the **Comments** field.
4. Click **Send**.


You will receive an email when the instance has been created, which includes the **instance ID** for the customerâ€™s new instance and a link to log into the Empathy Platform and access the **Instance Management** to continue configuring the instance setup.


:::note

When you access **Instance Management** in the Playboard main menu, you view the configuration for the _current instance_.   
To edit the configuration for other instances, you need to change the instance by returning to the **Instance landing page** or using the **Instance tab** and clicking one of the instances listed.
