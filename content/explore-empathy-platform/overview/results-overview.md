> Displaying what your shoppers want to find  

The search engine results page (SERP) typically contains *organic results*. In other words, **[product results](product-results-overview.md)** (C) that appear as a result of the search engine’s algorithm, considered to be the overall best, most relevant results for a given search query. 
Displaying product results is a big deal. It's not only about returning matching products, it’s also about presenting the product results smartly. Leverage and tailor how you display product results with a set of different frontend elements.

The SERP can include other elements to guide shoppers to the information they want. You can feature **[promotion banners](/explore-empathy-platform/features/promotions-overview.md#promotion-banners)** (A) that span the width of the results grid and **[promoted results](/explore-empathy-platform/features/promotions-overview.md#promoted-results)** (B) displayed like other product results, intended to highlight promotions shown in specific landing or category pages. For example, a banner referring to special occasions such as Valentine’s Day with a link to a dedicated blog post on gift ideas or an image of a television on sale that links to the product detail page (PDP).

::: note

Promotion banners and promoted results show up on the SERP when shoppers search for specific queries. You can set up promotion banners and promoted results for a particular query or all queries using the **Promotion management tool** in the Empathy Platform Playboard. See [Feature promotions on the SERP](/explore-empathy-platform/fine-tune-search-and-discovery/use-promotions.md) to learn how to determine the queries for which you want to display the promotion.

In addition to these types of results, other advanced discovery features such as **[Recommendations](/explore-empathy-platform/features/recommendations-overview.md)** and **[Next Queries](/explore-empathy-platform/features/next-queries-overview.md)** (D) can be showcased on the SERP next to product results.

Shoppers expect to always receive a bunch of results when searching. However, when dealing with long or complex queries, they may find **no results**. Depending on the type of business and catalogue, you may choose to return **[partial results](/explore-empathy-platform/features/partial-results-overview.md)** instead, providing product results corresponding to terms close to those of the search. Showing results that partially match the query to minimize your shoppers’ frustration. 

## Use results to...
- Help your shoppers find the products they’re looking for easily. 
- Leverage advanced search features such as Recommendations and ID Results.
- Offer a smooth shopping experience by adding images and helpful result-related information.
