title: Commerce search basics

---

Creating an irresistible search experience is key for your commerce store's success. Shoppers must be able to search and find in the catalogue what’s important to them. 

To bring your product catalogue to shoppers, a carefully crafted **[pre-search experience](#pre-search-experience)**, a well designed **[search engine results page](#search-engine-results-page-serp)**, and a **[product detail page](#product-detail-page-pdp)** where you can gain insights into shopper intent are key.

## Pre-search experience
 Without realizing it, the search experience begins even before shoppers start to type. Brands are increasingly turning to the **[search box](search-box-overview.md)** as the way to build a conversation with their customers in a refreshing and fluid way.  

 But not only that, the new search experience is typeless, guiding and assisting using the **[predictive layer](predictive-layer.md)** to offer shoppers ways to quickly find what they’re looking for using features such as Query Suggestions or Next Queries, all without having to type again in the search box.

    'query_suggestions',
    'history_queries',
    'recommendations',
    'popular_searches',
    'next_queries']"
/>


## Search engine results page (SERP)
The search engine results page is the page showing the results that the search engine returns after a shopper submits a search query. It presents the different types of **[product results displayed on the SERP](results-overview.md)** and allows your shoppers to discover your product catalogue with a set of features to [organize](pagination-overview.md), [sort](sorting-overview.md), and [filter](facets-and-filters-overview.md) search results.   

Shoppers may never need to see zero results, as **[synonyms](../features/synonyms-overview.md)**, **[spell check](../features/spellcheck-overview.md)**, and **[partial results](../features/partial-results-overview.md)** make sure there are always products shown.  

You can manage how products are listed on the SERP, modifying **[product](../features/product-ranking-overview.md)** or **[attribute](../features/attribute-ranking-overview.md) ranking** to boost or bury products according to business needs.

<CardCarousel :cards="[
    'product_results',
    'facets',
    'sorting',
    'pagination',
    'spellcheck',
    'synonyms',
    'product_ranking',
    'attribute_ranking',
    'recommendations',
    'partial_results']"
/>


## Product detail page (PDP)
The product detail page is the page where shoppers find specific information about the products. It's an invitation to shoppers to explore the product's characteristics through descriptions and specifications, product images, and videos, find out more about in-store availability, shipping lead times, and ultimately, purchase the product with add-to-cart buttons. It often features product recommendations and comparisons, as well as add-to-wishlist buttons to make product research easier.

You can allow shoppers to search and go directly to the product using **[ID Results](../features/id-results-overview.md)** or link directly to specific product pages using **[Redirections](../features/redirections-overview.md)** (as well as to other URLs).

<CardCarousel :cards="[
    'id_results',
    'redirections']"
/>

It's important to track shoppers interactions in these pages for enhanced search results and suggestions. For more information about how to track shopper interaction in the PDP, see [Shopper interactions tracked in your store](../capture-shopper-interaction/interaction-events.md).
