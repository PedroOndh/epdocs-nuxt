Recommendations shows the top searched items. That’s to say, the most clicked products on the search results page, based on shopper interaction within a defined period.

![Recommendations](~@assets/media/features/overview-recommendations.svg)

Recommendations are relevant product suggestions; they aren’t related to the query, but to products that matched previous searches done by other shoppers, instead. They are useful in numerous situations, especially when there are no search results to show. Whether a shopper lands on your shop and hasn’t written any query yet or if a search doesn’t bring back any product results, Recommendations amaze shoppers with product discovery inspirations.


## Spot the difference  
Notice that Recommendations guide shoppers to specific products. When clicking on a recommendation, the related product description page displays without any further interaction. No need to search or navigate the results. Try to not confuse it with the [Popular Searches](/explore-empathy-platform/features/popular-searches-overview.md) feature, which presents the top searched queries to trigger a new search.

For example, “off-the-shoulder ditsy floral dress” can refer to a top-clicked specific product that redirects to the product description. But “dress”, “floral dress”, or “off-the-shoulder dress” express a currently top searched query, prompting a new search and displaying relevant results such as “off-the-shoulder ditsy floral dress”, among others.

You can identify Recommendations mostly under labels like _Top searched items today_.

::: note

Remember that other types of suggestions can display hints based on [queries](/explore-empathy-platform/features/query-suggestions-overview.md), [search history](/explore-empathy-platform/features/history-queries-overview.md), or even [product references](/explore-empathy-platform/features/id-results-overview.md).

## Try Recommendations to...
- Improve product findability. Guide shoppers to products in your catalogue they don’t know.
- Enhance shopper experience. Surprise shoppers with new ideas or alternative products.
- Handle shopper frustration. Suggest products when there’s no query to suggest or no results to show.
- Speed up the search and discovery process, especially on mobile devices.


## The inner workings of Recommendations
Recommendations are generated by shoppers’ actions in the search UI. When shoppers perform different searches and actions, behavioral information (queries, clicks, add to cart, etc.) is collected using the Tagging microservices and processed by the Search microservice.

This information is collected by the TopClicked batch process to generate a feed with the final recommended products that are ready to go.
