> The best friend who always ends your sentences

List of predictions that display whenever the shoppers type, designed to help them to complete and nail down the query. This feature not only minimizes having to write the whole query, but it also helps you to show shoppers what to look for to get relevant results. What’s more, it’s a great way of providing deeper access to the product catalogue.

## Spot the difference 
Do not mix up Query Suggestions with query [results](/explore-empathy-platform/overview/results-overview.md). Query Suggestions are hints to improve query formulation, guaranteeing that shoppers get accurate results. 

For example, _shirt dress_, _knit dress_, or _maxi dress_ can be suggestions for the query “dress”, bringing out more specific and narrowed results. 

::: note  

Remember that Query Suggestions appear when shoppers interact with the search box. But there are other types of suggestions that can display hints based on [trends](/explore-empathy-platform/features/popular-searches-overview.md), [search history](/explore-empathy-platform/search/history-queries-overview.md), or [product references](/explore-empathy-platform/features/id-results-overview.md) before shoppers have started to type.

## Try Query Suggestions to...
- Anticipate shopper intent using machine learning technology.
- Speed up query entry, especially for mobile devices.
- Sharpen query formulation. Educate shoppers on how to perform better queries.
- Improve product findability. Guide shoppers to the products they want, even those they don’t know.
- Add spell-check and case-sensitivity behavior.


## The inner workings of Query Suggestions
Query Suggestions are generated by shoppers’ actions in the search UI. As shoppers perform different searches and actions in the shop, behavioral information (queries, clicks, add to cart, etc.) is collected using the Tagging microservices and processed by the Search microservice, and then processed by the Empathize batch process. 

The information is analysed to extract the keywords used on a specific query. So, from queries such as “shirt dress”, “knit dress”, or “maxi dress”, _shirt_, _knit_, _maxi_, and _dress_ are identified as suggestions for the query "dress". 

These candidate suggestions are then reviewed to check whether they are valid according to different filters (i.e. [blacklists](blacklist-overview.md), duplicity, etc.), resulting in a list of final suggestions that is ready to go.

For a correct performance, make sure that your current search service supports this type of feature.
