> OK. I want to find a dress… Hmm, long?... Er, short?... Maybe midi? Yeah! Definitely, I’ll go for midi!

Related Tags are descriptive keywords that complement and enhance the search query to make it easier for shoppers to find what they’re looking for with just one click. They’re closely related to the search query, fine-tuning the search to get highly relevant results. They only appear after the search process is completed, and the results appear. 

For example, people usually start searching using simple, broad term queries, such as “dress”. When they get loads of results, they realize that what they’re really searching for is a specific kind of dress. That’s when Related Tags come into play, providing extra and relevant information for a more precise search, like “long”, “midi”, or “maxi”.

## Organic and curated Related Tags
With Empathy Platform, you can show **organic** and **curated related tags** in your commerce store. Organic related tags are generated automatically based on collective behavioral information, offering related keywords to the searches that are used by other shoppers for a more accurate search. Alternatively, you may want to curate the search experience and suggest related search terms that shoppers might like to use to complement their initial search to drive sales as part of a Christmas campaign. For example, as search manager you want to guide shoppers towards party dresses by associating the "sequined" or "festive" terms as related tags for the query “dresses”, in addition to the organic related tags “party”, "black", or "long".  

Using the Related Tags curation tool in the Empathy Platform Playboard, you can review the organic related tags generated for a query, create new curated related tags that respond to marketing strategies, change the order in which the curated related tags appear, and choose to show or hide organic related tags.

## Spot the difference    
Don’t confuse Related Tags with [Facets and Filters](/explore-empathy-platform/overview/facets-and-filters-overview.md). Facets and Filters narrow down the search results to pinpoint products from a wide range of hits, while Related Tags complement the original search query, launching a new search that can bring up a new set of results or refine the existing ones. 

For example, you can search for the term “dress”, then select the “midi” related tag to refine the initial search and get more relevant results. Finally, you can select the “XS” filter from the Size category to filter and display all extra-small midi dresses. 

Likewise, try to not mix it up with [Query Suggestions](/explore-empathy-platform/features/query-suggestions-overview.md) since they refine the query while you’re typing it before launching the initial search. Bear in mind, however, sometimes the suggestions that display for Related Tags and Query Suggestions are the same.

You can identify Related Tags as they look like actual tags or labels located beneath the search bar, once a search is launched and the results are displayed.

::: note 

Remember that other types of suggestions can display hints based on [search history](/explore-empathy-platform/features/history-queries-overview.md) or even [trending products](/explore-empathy-platform/features/recommendations-overview.md).

## The inner workings of Related Tags
Related Tags are generated by shoppers’ actions in the search UI. As shoppers perform different searches and actions, behavioral information (queries, clicks, add to cart, etc.) is collected using the [Tagging microservices](/explore-empathy-platform/capture-shopper-interaction/README.md) and processed in the **Query Signals batch process** to extract the most relevant data for a specific query.

The information is then analyzed to select the appropriate candidate tags related to a specific query. So, from queries such as “long dress”, “midi dress”, or “maxi dress”, _long_, _midi_, and _maxi_ are identified as the related tags for the query "dress". 

These candidate related tags are then reviewed to check whether they are valid according to different filters (i.e. [blacklists](blacklist-overview.md), duplicity, etc.), resulting in a list of final Related Tags that is ready to go.

Curated related tags are created manually by the commerce marketer or merchandiser in the Playboard and sent to the Beacon microservice to be stored with the organic related tags. When the shopper performs a search in the frontend, the Interface&nbsp;X&nbsp;Components call the [Beacon API](/develop-empathy-platform/api-reference/beacon-api.md) to retrieve a list of organic and curated related tags associated with the query, displaying them in the commerce store after the initial search.
