> Could you repeat, please?

History Queries shows shoppers' recent searches. Shoppers can return to what they looked up earlier, so they can revisit the type of products they’ve viewed before in a few clicks. 

Although shoppers can repeat their most recent queries quickly and smoothly, it doesn’t mean that they’re redirected to a specific product. For example, if you look once for “dress”, and after several searches, you retrieve your first attempt, a new search for “dress” is set off, displaying all available results in your catalogue at that moment.

History Queries are ordered by the most recent searches and can appear before or during query formulation. However, while typing a query, history suggestions can change to match the current query. For example, while you’re writing “dress”, your search history is being filtered to display only the previously related searches, such as “long dress” and “knit dress”.

You can identify History Queries mostly under labels such as _previous searches_ or _my searches_.

**Providing a full search history with My History**  
History Queries displays the most recent history searches. But if you want to provide your shoppers with a complete list of all the searches they have performed from the very beginning on your commerce store, you need to implement My History dashboard. It displays the whole search history and allows shoppers to decide whether they want to track their search history or not.

## The inner workings of History Queries   
History Queries are based on the shopper's browsing history using the browser's local web data. This means that the shopper's history data isn’t stored in Empathy servers.
