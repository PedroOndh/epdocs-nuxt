> Be inspired by your shoppers' journey

Search and navigation data is an incredibly valuable asset and one often overlooked and under-exploited by online retailers. But when faced with realms and realms of raw data, knowing where to start and make sense of it all is complicated.   

Insights helps you to harness search and navigation data by using sophisticated intelligence and analysis to produce inspiring data visualizations and get significant information. They not only provide a visual big picture, but also stimulate creativity and ideas, allowing you to analyze, decipher, and capitalize on commerce search data. You can better understand your shoppers and drive appropriate actions based on their behavior, interactions, and search patterns so that they feel understood and enjoy a personalized shopping experience.

## Visualize data to find actionable insights
With Empathy Platform's Insights tool, each data visualization is carefully chosen and crafted to provide you an instant view of the patterns in data or to allow you explore reasons for disparity, combining different data visualization types such as mosaic plots, bubble clouds, and stream graphs to give you the full picture.   

Through a better understanding of data and shoppers’ behavior, you can make more informed decisions, anticipate trends, and detect opportunities. Get closer to your shoppers by taking advantage of the actionable search information that Insights brings at your fingertips. Promote those products your shoppers may find relevant based on the data gained on your shoppers' searches and the products that engaged them most. What’s more, you can improve search and navigation performance and enhance shopper experience straightaway with the [Empathy Platform Playboard's tools](/explore-empathy-platform/overview/playboard-overview.md).


## Data visualizations for multiple perspectives
Insights includes visual representations of all datasets available for Empathy Platform, following a data-driven storytelling approach, so that you can analyze search performance from different perspectives:

- **Now**: Explore the queries used in the last 15 minutes, one hour, or 12 hours. Hover over the data bubbles to view how many times a query has been used by shoppers, how many clicks have been made per query, and how many times a query has resulted in a shopping dead-end. Knowing what your shoppers are searching for but not finding is just as imporant as knowing what your shoppers are finding to keep your shoppers engaged. Learn more about Now dataviz in **[Visualize query performance with Now](/explore-empathy-platform/analyze-search-and-discovery/use-now.md)**.
- **Categories**: Focus on the performance of each product category for the last week in the search experience. Navigate around the clickable treemap to explore the KPIs you’re interested in for each category—Queries, Findability, and Add to Cart. Data from the selected category is interactively displayed and listed per query. In addition, you can easily download the data related to any category for further analysis. <!-- add link when documentation is ready: Learn more about Categories dataviz in **[Visualize product category performance with Categories](/explore-empathy-platform/analyze-search-and-discovery/use.categories.md)**.-->
- **Origins**: Understand the source of shoppers' search experience over the last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or custom range. Scroll through the animated visualization to reveal the search path shoppers take to find what they are looking for. Knowing whether your shoppers use *organic* queries or they opt for any predictive and refinement search features helps you to detect shopping patterns and drive actions on the definition of your product catalogue and search and discovery features.
- **Terms**: Detect popular terms used in search queries over the last 24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or custom range to anticipate future shoppers’ searches with relevant suggestions.
