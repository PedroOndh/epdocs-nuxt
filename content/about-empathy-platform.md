### Leading the way in ethical, empathetic commerce search & discovery

Empathy Platform is a trusted search and discovery solution that helps connect shoppers with your products by offering joyful shopping experiences, ethical personalization, and powerful merchandising tools. Empathy Platform drives control and transparency over search suggestions and results, while giving merchandisers the tools and insights they need to design engaging commerce experiences.

#### Headless architecture

Empathy Platform uses a headless approach with API-first backend microservices that are fully decoupled from the composable frontend. Gain all the advantages of decentralized governance and data management, and build an expressive digital experience that represents your brand.
