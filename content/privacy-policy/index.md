## 3. What is the legal basis for processing your data?
Where you must fill in a form and click “Submit” button to make a request, completing the form and submitting it will imply that you have been informed and have expressly given your consent to receive the newsletter, the content of the annexed clause, and/or have accepted our Privacy Policy.

All our forms show the asterisk symbol (*) when data is mandatory. If you do not complete these fields, or do not tick the “I accept…” checkbox for the Privacy Policy, you will not be allowed to send the form. The following formula is usually shown: “□ I am over 14 and I have read and accept the Privacy Policy.”

## 4. How long do we keep your personal data?
Your personal data is kept for as long as you have a relationship with us.

Once that relation is terminated, the personal data processed for each purpose will be kept for the legally established period, including the period during which a judge or a court may request it, the lapse period for legal actions being taken into account.

Processed data will be kept for as long as the legal deadlines referred to above do not expire, if there is a legal obligation to keep it, or in the case there is no legal deadline, until you request to have such data suppressed or you withdraw your consent.

We will keep all information and communications about your purchase or the provision of our service for as long as the guarantees over products or services are valid, so as to deal with possible claims.

In the case of CVs submitted as part of a recruitment process, any copies of CVs and other personal data provided as part of the recruitment process will be destroyed one year after the date of submission.

For personal data provided via social networks, the consultation or cancellation of your data is restricted as it forms part of a specific profile. We will only process your data as long as you allow us do so, by following or clicking on “Like”, “Continue” or similar buttons.

Any rectification of your data or restriction on information or publications via social networks must be made through the configuration of your profile or user on the social network itself.

In cases where the legal basis of the treatment is your consent, until you revoke it.

## 5. How do we protect and safeguard your personal data?
Rest assured, we have adopted an optimal level of protection for the Personal Data that we handle, and we have installed all the means and technical measures at our disposal in accordance with the technology available to avoid personal data loss, misuse, alteration, unauthorised access, and theft.

### Who has access to your personal data and to whom is it disclosed?
Your data will not be transferred to third parties, unless there is a legal obligation to do so. Specifically, your data will be communicated to the Tax Authority and to banks and financial entities for collection for the service provided or product acquired and to those in charge of data processing, as necessary to perform the agreement.

In the event of purchase or payment, if you choose an application, platform, bank card, or another online service, your data will be transferred to that platform or will be processed in its environment, always with the utmost security.

All third party companies that we work with and who may have access to this data will have signed a service provision agreement that obliges them to uphold the same privacy standards as we do.
