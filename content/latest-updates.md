<Update date="10.06.2022" title="Configure Empathy Platform using the CMC" theme="dark">

Building memorable search and discovery experiences involves streamlining the deployment process. Partners now have all the information they need to implement Empathy Platform using **Instance Management**.

The new [Configure Empathy Platform](/explore-empathy-platform/configure-empathy-platform) section in Empathy Platform Docs guides partners through the steps to tailor search and discovery experiences for their brands. First, partners [request and create a new instance](/explore-empathy-platform/configure-empathy-platform/request-instance.md) in the Empathy Platform Playboard. Then, they adjust the settings of the Empathy Platform's microservices. For instance, partners learn how to [set the tagging parameters](/explore-empathy-platform/configure-empathy-platform/configure-tagging.md) to capture shoppers' interactions, [configure the Playboard](/explore-empathy-platform/configure-empathy-platform/configure-playboard.md) and link it to other microservices, [set up the batch processes](/explore-empathy-platform/configure-empathy-platform/configure-conversational-services.md) that generate suggestions and intent models, [configure search features and endpoints](/explore-empathy-platform/configure-empathy-platform/configure-search-service/), and even [check out the options to report metrics](/explore-empathy-platform/configure-empathy-platform/configure-reporting-settings.md).

<Update date="08.25.2022" title="Display shoppers' search history with My History" theme="dark">

 When dealing with huge product catalogues, shoppers may find it difficult to reach a determined product they liked in the past but can’t remember the search query they launched. Providing shoppers with a way to access the complete list of searches made on your commerce store was the initial milestone in the development of My History. But, in the quest to preserve shoppers' privacy, you can even help your shoppers take control of their own search history.

Now that My History has been released for web and Android, all the related information you may need is now available! Start with an [**overview of the feature**](/explore-empathy-platform/features/my-history-overview.md) and learn all the things your shoppers can do. Then, you can move on to the frontend side to check all the [UI options](/explore-empathy-platform/experience-search-and-discovery/my-history.md) for designing the best shopper experience. Lastly, share with your development team the very technical in and outs they can find in the [Interface X Components UI Reference](/develop-empathy-platform/ui-reference/components/history-queries/x-components.my-history).

<Update date="11.18.2021" title="Integrate tagging events using the Tagging API" theme="dark">
Capturing relevant interaction data for generating relevant search suggestions and analytics without storing profiling or location information is one of the pillars of Empathy Platform. Empathy Platform’s tagging microservice is responsible for collecting and aggregating shopper interaction in your commerce store to transform it into actionable data. 
To integrate Empathy Platform tagging in your commerce store, you need to send events to the tagging API every time a shopper interacts with your store by clicking on a search result or adding a product to the cart. Check out what you need to know before integrating tagging in [Prepare to capture shopper interaction](/explore-empathy-platform/capture-shopper-interaction/prepare-tagging.md).
Once you know what information you need, discover the [ways you can integrate with the Tagging API](/develop-empathy-platform/capture-interaction-signals/) and access the [Tagging API reference documentation](/develop-empathy-platform/api-reference/tagging-api.md) for a more detailed description of the endpoints and query parameters.
